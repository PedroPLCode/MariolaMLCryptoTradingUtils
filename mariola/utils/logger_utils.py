    Initializes the logger by loading the log file path from a JSON settings file.

    Reads the `settings_filename` JSON file to extract the `log_filename` value,
    which determines where log messages will be written. If the file does not exist,
    is invalid JSON, or does not contain the required key, the program exits with an error message.

    This function modifies the global variable `log_filename` with the log file path.

    Parameters:
        settings_filename (str): The path to the JSON settings file.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the `settings_filename` file does not exist.
        json.JSONDecodeError: If the file is not valid JSON.
        KeyError: If the `log_filename` key is missing in the JSON.
